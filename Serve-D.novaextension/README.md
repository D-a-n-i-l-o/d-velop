# Serve-D Exension for Nova

**Serve-D** provides deep integration with [**D**][1] via the [Serve-D][2] Language Server.

This includes support for syntax highlighting via a [Tree-sitter][3] D [grammar][4], indentation,
and folding.  If you have installed our _D_ extension, you may disable that as this
extension includes all of that functionality as well.

## Requirements

Serve-D requires the actual `serve-d` language server to be installed
on your Mac.  Most often this will be located in `/usr/local/bin`.

As of this release, it is required to update to a current nightly build,
or to build the server yourself.  In particular, releases **0.7.4** and earlier
will *not* work with this extension.  (Hopefully a new version will be
released soon, and we can update this message here.)


## Usage

<!--
ðŸŽˆ If your extension provides features that are invoked manually, consider describing those options for users:
-->

To run Serve-D:

- Select the **Editor â†’ Serve-D** menu item; or
- Open the command palette and type `Serve-D`

<!--
ðŸŽˆ Alternatively, if your extension runs automatically (as in the case of a validator), consider showing users what they can expect to see:
-->

Serve-D runs any time you open a local project, automatically lints all open files, then reports errors and warnings in Nova's **Issues** sidebar and the editor gutter.

### Configuration

<!--
ðŸŽˆ If your extension offers global- or workspace-scoped preferences, consider pointing users toward those settings. For example:
-->

To configure global preferences, open **Extensions â†’ Extension Library...** then select Serve-D's **Preferences** tab.

You can also configure preferences on a per-project basis in **Project â†’ Project Settings...**
