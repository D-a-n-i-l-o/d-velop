# D Language support for [Nova][1]

More information about the plugin can be found in the
`D-Velop.novaextension` directory.

This includes the Tree-sitter syntax support for D,
LSP support via `serve-d` and so forth.

This extension is [available][2] in the normal extension library.

Note that the extension ID is `tech.staysail.ServeD`, which references
the old extension name. This is done to preserve settings for people
who used earlier versions before we renamed the extension.

## Building

You can build using just "make".
